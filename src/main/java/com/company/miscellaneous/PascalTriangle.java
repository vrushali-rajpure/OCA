/**
 * First we know about Pascal Triangle what is this and how we design this triangle in general;
 Pascal's triangle is a set of numbers arranged in the form of a triangle.
 Each number in a row is the sum of the left number and right number on the above row.
 If a number is missing in the above row, it is assumed to be 0.
